        The 2026 State Games of America is coming to State College, PA &ndash; and Legacy Boxing & Combat Sports
        Academy has been named the official host of the Combat Sports Showcase. The event runs August 1&ndash;2, 2026
        at Legacy Boxing's facility (2820 East College Ave, Suite F, State College) as part of the larger State Games of
        America, which spans July 24 through
        August 2.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10">What is the State Games of America?</h2>

      <p>
        The State Games of America (SGA) is the nation's largest multi-sport event for amateur athletes. Organized by
        the National Congress of State Games, SGA brings together competitors from all 50 states across 50+ sports.
        Think of it as a domestic Olympic-style competition &ndash; complete with opening ceremonies, medal events, and
        a festival atmosphere that draws thousands of athletes and spectators to the host city.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2026, that host city is State College. The combat sports events will be held at Legacy Boxing & Combat Sports
        Academy (2820 East College Ave, Suite F), putting our community on the national stage for amateur athletics.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10">What to expect at the Combat Sports Showcase</h2>

      <p>
        The Combat Sports Showcase will feature both boxing and MMA competition. Boxing bouts are sanctioned by USA
        Boxing and the National Collegiate Boxing Association (NCBA), meaning certified officials, proper weight
        classes, and full safety protocols.
      </p>

      <p>
        Athletes from local boxing clubs and collegiate programs from across the country will compete. This includes
        developing amateur talent as well as experienced collegiate boxers from NCBA member programs &ndash; making it
        one of the premier amateur boxing events in the region.
      </p>

      <p>
        MMA competition details are still being finalized. We'll publish specifics as the Keystone Games organizers
        release their MMA event page. In the meantime, contact us if you're interested in competing or want to stay
        updated.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10">Boxing weight classes</h2>

      <p>
        NCBA weight classes will be used for the boxing competition. Men's divisions range from 119 lbs through
        heavyweight (201&ndash;299 lbs), and women's divisions span 112 lbs through 176+ lbs heavyweight. Full weight
        class details are available on our

          class="text-boxing-red hover:underline"
        >Keystone Games event page</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10">How to register</h2>

      <p>
        Boxing registration is open now through the
        <a

          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          class="text-boxing-red hover:underline"
        >official RaceReach portal</a>.
        Spots are expected to fill fast &ndash; the State Games of America draws competitors from every state, and many
        sports reach capacity well before the event.
      </p>

      <p>
        You do not need to be a Legacy Boxing member to compete. The event is open to any eligible amateur athlete from
        a USA Boxing registered club or NCBA collegiate program.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10">Why this matters for Legacy Boxing</h2>

      <p>
        Being selected to host the combat sports portion of the SGA is a recognition of what Coach Derek Roth and the
        Legacy Boxing team have built in State College. From training complete beginners to preparing NCBA collegiate
        competitors, our gym has become Central Pennsylvania's home for boxing and combat sports &ndash; and now we get
        to share that with athletes from across the nation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're planning to compete, spectate, or just want to train with us leading up to the event, we'd love
        to hear from you.
