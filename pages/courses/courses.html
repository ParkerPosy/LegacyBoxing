    <!-- Adult Boxing Program -->
    <div class="mb-8">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-boxing-red mb-3">Boxing</h3>
      <div class="text-lg space-y-4">
        <p>At Legacy, we teach the same techniques used by Golden Gloves competitors, All-Americans, and National
          Champions. Whether you're aiming to compete or just want to train like a boxer, you'll build real
          skills, boost your conditioning, and experience the structure and discipline that set our fighters
          apart.
        </p>

        <p>Sparring is never required and will only be introduced when your coach believes you're ready. Before
          that point, we incorporate Shoulder Tag, a foundational drill originating from Cuban boxing that
          sharpens speed, reflexes,
          footwork, and defensive awareness in a safe and controlled way. It's a fun, high-skill exercise that
          builds confidence and timing without the risk of injury.</p>

        <p>Our philosophy is simple: train like you're going to fight, even if you never step into the ring. That
          way, every athlete walks away with the fitness, technique, and mindset of a true boxer.</p>

      <div class="text-lg space-y-4">
        <p><span class="font-semibold">The "Mixed" in Mixed Martial Arts</span></p>

        <p>Our MMA classes focus on what the sport's really about: combining striking and grappling into one fluid
          system. Each session pulls from boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, submission
          grappling, and catch wrestling.</p>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">What You'll Do:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Train striking-only and grappling-only techniques</li>
            <li>Practice clinch work, takedowns, and transitions</li>
            <li>Learn to strike while defending takedowns and grapple under pressure</li>
            <li>Put everything together through live, integrated drills</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>This isn't just cross-training. It's real MMA, taught the right way.</p>
        <p>Build timing, control, and complete fight-ready skills in every class.</p>

      <div class="text-lg space-y-4">
        <p>Our Youth Program is designed to teach young athletes the fundamentals of boxing and combat sports,
          while fostering discipline, confidence, and resilience. Under the guidance of the head coach of Penn
          State University's boxing team, a team with a proud 102-year legacy that currently ranks among the top 5

          programs in the nation, students receive high-level instruction in a safe, supportive, and structured
          environment.</p>

        <p>Boxing is more than a sport; it prepares students to handle real-world challenges by setting achievable
          goals, building mental toughness, and teaching healthy ways to cope with stress. Training is often
          supported by accomplished student-athletes who serve as positive role models, enriching the experience
          both in and out of the ring.</p>

        <p>Most importantly, our Youth Program is designed to be engaging and enjoyable. Judging by the enthusiasm
          and feedback from our young athletes, we are succeeding in making every session a rewarding experience.
