        <p>Our Youth Program is about more than just boxing – it's about giving young athletes the tools to grow
          stronger both inside and out. Classes are led by USA Boxing certified coaches and supported by accomplished
          student-athletes from the nationally ranked Penn State Boxing Team. These mentors help guide drills and serve
          as role models your child can look up to.</p>
        <p>Kids will learn proper boxing fundamentals, footwork, coordination, and self-control in an environment that's
          welcoming and age-appropriate. Every session is designed to build character, focus, and resilience – all while
          having fun and staying active.</p>
        <p>There's no sparring or contact required. We use skill-building games and controlled partner drills like
          Shoulder Tag to develop awareness, movement, and timing in a fun and safe way.</p>
        <p>Our team works closely with each child, offering patient instruction and positive reinforcement. Whether your
          child is shy, energetic, athletic, or totally new to sports, they'll find encouragement and belonging here.
        </p>
        <p>Our partnership with the Penn State Boxing Team brings accomplished college boxers with a high-level
          of experience and a genuine passion for mentoring. They lead drills, offer encouragement, and help every
          student feel confident – whether it's their first day or they're returning for another season.</p>
