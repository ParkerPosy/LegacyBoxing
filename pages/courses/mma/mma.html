        </div>
        <p>Legacy's MMA program seamlessly combines striking, takedowns, and ground control into a progressive
          curriculum. Drawing techniques from boxing, Muay Thai, BJJ, wrestling, and Judo, we teach you to transition
          between disciplines fluently. Our curriculum includes techniques from all these martial arts:</p>

        <p>Classes are led by Coach Derek Roth, a nationally recognized instructor and former competitor with over 30
          years of experience across multiple martial arts disciplines. As Head Coach of the Penn State Boxing Club and
          the 2023 NCBA Coach of the Year, he brings a rare level of knowledge and professionalism to every session.
          You'll be learning from a coach who knows how to develop fighters and beginners alike.</p>

        <p>We don't just teach isolated techniques or "random" moves. Our integrated approach connects striking, clinch
          work, and grappling skills into a fluid system that builds real fighting capability – whether you're sparring,
          preparing for your first amateur fight, or just training to push yourself. Every student receives focused
          instruction and a clear progression plan, with live practice (drilling and controlled sparring) tailored to
          your experience and goals. No wasted reps, no guesswork – just real training with real results.</p>

        </div>
        <p>
          Our mixed martial arts program is ideal for adults and teens in State College looking to start MMA, get in
          shape, learn self-defense, or prepare for amateur competition. Whether you're coming from a striking,
          wrestling, or jiu-jitsu background – or starting completely fresh – you'll find a training system that meets
          you at your level and helps you reach your goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as you're willing to work hard and learn, you will fit right in. Many of our members are Penn State
          students or busy working adults who make time in their week for MMA training. If you're completely new to
          martial arts, don't worry – our coaches will guide you step-by-step from day one, building your confidence
          with each class. If you do have prior experience (in boxing, wrestling, BJJ, etc.), we'll help you integrate
          those skills and advance to the next level. Male and female students of all fitness levels are welcome – our
          gym culture is friendly, supportive, and focused on everyone's success.

            Not at all. Our MMA program is designed for complete beginners as well as experienced martial artists.
            You'll
            start with the basics and build up your skills and fitness over time. Many students join with no prior
            experience or fitness background – some are Penn State students who have never tried martial arts before –
            and they quickly improve with our beginner-friendly approach. If you're already in shape or have trained
            elsewhere, that's great, but it's not a requirement. Come as you are, and we will help you progress at a
            pace that's right for you.

            For your first few classes, just wear comfortable athletic clothing (t-shirt, shorts or leggings) and bring
            a water bottle. We train on padded mats, so wrestling shoes are recommended. We have loaner gloves
            and protective gear (like focus mitts, Thai pads, etc.) available for beginners. As you continue training,
            we recommend investing in your own boxing/MMA gloves, 180-inch wrist wraps, a mouthguard, and shin guards
            for striking – but there's no need to have these on day one. Our staff can advise you on what gear to get
            when you're ready.

            Safety is our top priority. Beginners will not be thrown straight into hard sparring. Our classes
            incorporate drilling and light contact exercises to build your skills and confidence. Any sparring or live
            rolling we do is closely supervised by the coach and kept at a level appropriate to your experience. You'll
            wear protective gear (gloves, mouthguard, etc.), and more experienced partners will work with you safely.
            Injuries are rare and we take care to ensure everyone trains smart. As you gain experience, you can choose
            to participate in more intense sparring rounds, but it's always optional and introduced gradually. In short,
            MMA training at Legacy is as safe as any other sport – you'll be challenged, but we keep it controlled and
            beginner-friendly.

            Absolutely! We welcome Penn State students – in fact, a large part of our membership is made up of PSU
            students and staff. Our gym is only a few minutes from campus, and easily accessible by car or CATA bus.
            (There's plenty of free parking at our facility if you drive.) Class times in the evenings and on Saturdays
            are scheduled to fit a student's busy class timetable, so you can train after your academic day is done.
            Coach Derek's role as the PSU Boxing Club head coach also means you'll be training under someone very
            familiar with the Penn State community. Whether you're an undergrad or grad student, you'll find our
            schedule and location very convenient. Training MMA is a great outlet from studies – and you might even meet
            fellow Penn Staters in class!

            Yes, our MMA program is open to teens (typically ages 16 and up) as well as adults. Teenagers often train
            alongside adults in our regular classes, with coaching adjusted as needed to their age and skill level. It's
            a fantastic way for teens to build confidence, get in shape, and learn self-defense in a controlled setting.
            For younger children below the early teen years, we offer separate youth martial arts programs (through our
            academy's youth classes) that focus on foundational skills in a fun, safe environment. If you're unsure
            which program is best for your child, just reach out and we'll help you find the perfect fit.

            That's completely up to you. Many of our members train for personal development, fitness, and fun without
            ever competing, and that's 100% okay. However, if you do have goals to compete in MMA, boxing, Muay Thai, or
            BJJ, we can certainly help you on that path. Coach Derek has experience preparing fighters for amateur
            competition and can guide dedicated students through fight camps and advanced training when the time comes.
            We've had students participate in local boxing matches and grappling tournaments. When you're ready and have
            built a solid foundation, we'll support you in testing your skills in the ring or cage. Competition is
            optional – you won't be pressured to fight – but if it's something you aspire to, Legacy Boxing & Combat
            Sports Academy is equipped to train you for it.
