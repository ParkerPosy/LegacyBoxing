You'll start with the basics and build up your skills and fitness over time. Many students join with no prior experience or fitness background and they quickly improve with our beginner-friendly approach. Come as you are, and we will help you progress at a pace that's right for you."

We have loaner gloves and protective gear available for beginners. As you continue training, we recommend investing in your own boxing/MMA gloves, wrist wraps, a mouthguard, and shin guards — but there's no need to have these on day one."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Safety is our top priority. Beginners will not be thrown straight into hard sparring. Our classes incorporate drilling and light contact exercises to build your skills and confidence. Any sparring is closely supervised and kept at a level appropriate to your experience. As you gain experience, you can choose to participate in more intense sparring rounds, but it's always optional and introduced gradually."

Our gym is only a few minutes from campus, easily accessible by car or CATA bus with free parking. Class times in the evenings and on Saturdays fit a student's schedule. Coach Derek is also the PSU Boxing Club head coach."

However, if you do have goals to compete in MMA, boxing, Muay Thai, or grappling, Coach Derek can guide dedicated students through fight camps and advanced training. Competition is optional — you won't be pressured to fight."
