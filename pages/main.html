      <p>Ready to train like a real fighter? At <span class="text-boxing-red font-semibold">Legacy Boxing and Combat
          Sports Academy</span> you'll build authentic boxing and mixed martial arts skills, boost
        your fitness,
        and develop the discipline that drives lasting results inside and outside the gym. We offer structured boxing
        classes and MMA training consisting of kickboxing, Muay Thai, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and more designed for
        beginners to advanced fighters alike.</p>

      <p>Our <span class="font-bold">Boxing Classes</span> teach the same techniques used by Golden Gloves
        competitors, All-Americans, and national champions. Sparring is never required and only introduced when you're
        fully prepared, with safety and readiness as the top priority. You'll build real technique, conditioning, and
        fight IQ through focused drills like Shoulder Tag, a Cuban boxing drill that safely builds speed, coordination,
        and sharp defensive awareness in a fun, engaging way. Our program is ideal whether you're training for amateur
        boxing, preparing for your first fight, or simply looking for a real boxing gym instead of a cardio-focused
        class.
      </p>

      <p>Our <span class="font-bold">Youth Boxing Classes</span>, open to ages 8 to 16, offer a safe and
        structured boxing class for kids where they
        build confidence, coordination, and lifelong skills. With monthly memberships and convenient drop-in options,
        families can stay consistent without needing to commit to seasonal camps. All instruction is led by USA Boxing
        certified coaches who prioritize safety, motivation, and age-appropriate training.</p>

      <p>Memberships start at <span class="font-bold">$75</span> per month for adult boxing or MMA, and <span
          class="font-bold"
        >$60</span> for children. Private
        boxing lessons, facility rentals, and drop-in options are also available. Whether you're looking to compete or
        just get in shape, our gym is where your boxing journey begins.</p>
