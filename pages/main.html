        >Boxing Classes</a> teach the same techniques used by Golden Gloves
        competitors, All-Americans, and national champions. Sparring is never required and only introduced when you're
        fully prepared, with safety and readiness as the top priority. You'll build real technique, conditioning, and
        fight IQ through focused drills like Shoulder Tag, a Cuban boxing drill that safely builds speed, coordination,
        and sharp defensive awareness in a fun, engaging way. Our program is ideal whether you're training for amateur
        boxing, preparing for your first fight, or simply looking for a real boxing gym instead of a cardio-focused
        class.

        system – this is real mixed martial arts, taught the right way. Each session combines techniques from boxing,
        kickboxing, Muay Thai, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, submission grappling, and catch wrestling. You'll work
        through
        striking-only and grappling-only drills, learn clinch work and takedowns, and practice defending and attacking
        under pressure. Every class builds timing, control, and true fight-ready skills, whether you're new to MMA or
        leveling up your game.

        </h3>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p>Marc Hessel created and led the photography program in the Penn State University School of Visual
            Arts for 33 years, retiring as Professor Emeritus. He was awarded a National Endowment Fellowship in the
            Arts for his Puerto Rico portfolio, where he also developed a lifelong photography project. During that
            time, he had the privilege of photographing world champions Félix “Tito” Trinidad and Iván “Iron Boy”
            Calderón, as well as heavyweight contender Fres Oquendo, while they trained in Puerto Rico. This work
            sharpened his ability to observe detail – a skill that later carried over into coaching.</p>
          <p>In 2005, when amateur boxer Héctor Rosario turned professional, Rosario invited Coach Marc to join Team
            Rosario as an assistant trainer. He went on to support the team not only in boxing preparation but also by
            supervising nutrition, drawing on his background in science as a pre-med undergraduate and graduate
            researcher in biology. From 2012 to 2017, he also assisted Pennsylvania pro Grayson Blake in his training.
          </p>
          <p>In 2014, he was invited to help coach the Penn State Boxing Club's competition team, where he continues to
            serve as assistant coach.</p>
          <p>Although he never boxed himself, Coach Marc has been an avid student of the sport since childhood. While
            his
            peers collected baseball cards growing up in New York, he collected boxing cards – a sign that boxing was
            always part of his destiny.</p>
