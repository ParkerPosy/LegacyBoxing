      <p>Ready to train like a real fighter? At <span class="text-boxing-red font-semibold">Legacy Boxing and Combat
          Sports Academy</span> you'll build authentic boxing and mixed martial arts skills, boost
        your fitness, and develop the discipline that drives lasting results inside and outside the gym. We offer
        structured boxing classes and authentic mixed martial arts training designed for beginners to advanced fighters
        alike.
      </p>

      <p>Our <span class="font-bold">Boxing Classes</span> teach the same techniques used by Golden Gloves
        competitors, All-Americans, and national champions. Sparring is never required and only introduced when you're
        fully prepared, with safety and readiness as the top priority. You'll build real technique, conditioning, and
        fight IQ through focused drills like Shoulder Tag, a Cuban boxing drill that safely builds speed, coordination,
        and sharp defensive awareness in a fun, engaging way. Our program is ideal whether you're training for amateur
        boxing, preparing for your first fight, or simply looking for a real boxing gym instead of a cardio-focused
        class.
      </p>

      <p>Our <span class="font-bold">MMA Classes</span> bring striking and grappling together into one complete
        system – this is real mixed martial arts, taught the right way. Each session combines techniques from boxing,
        kickboxing, Muay Thai, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, submission grappling, and catch wrestling. You'll work through
        striking-only and grappling-only drills, learn clinch work and takedowns, and practice defending and attacking
        under pressure. Every class builds timing, control, and true fight-ready skills, whether you're new to MMA or
        leveling up your game.
      </p>

      <p>Our <span class="font-bold">Youth Boxing Classes</span>, open to ages 8 to 16, offer a safe and
        structured boxing class for kids where they
        build confidence, coordination, and lifelong skills. With monthly memberships and convenient drop-in options,
        families can stay consistent without needing to commit to seasonal camps. All instruction is led by USA Boxing
        certified coaches who prioritize safety, motivation, and age-appropriate training.
      </p>

      <p>Memberships start at <span class="font-bold">$75</span> per month for adult boxing or MMA, and
        <span class="font-bold">$60</span> for children. Private boxing lessons, facility rentals, and drop-in options
        are also available. Your first class is free, so you can experience what sets our athletes apart before
        committing. Whether you're looking to compete or just get in shape, our gym is where your boxing journey begins.
