            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-boxing-red mb-3">Boxing</h3>
            <div class="text-lg space-y-4">
              <p>At Legacy, we teach the same techniques used by Golden Gloves competitors, All-Americans, and National
                Champions. Whether you're aiming to compete or just want to train like a boxer, you'll build real
                skills, boost your conditioning, and experience the structure and discipline that set our fighters
                apart.
              </p>

              <p>Sparring is never required and will only be introduced when your coach believes you're ready. Before
                that point, we incorporate Shoulder Tag, a foundational Cuban boxing drill that sharpens reflexes,
                footwork, and defensive awareness in a safe and controlled way. It's a fun, high-skill exercise that
                builds confidence and timing without the risk of injury.</p>

              <p>Our philosophy is simple: train like you're going to fight, even if you never step into the ring. That
                way, every athlete walks away with the fitness, technique, and mindset of a true boxer.</p>

              <p><span class="font-semibold">The "Mixed" in Mixed Martial Arts</span></p>

              <p>Our MMA classes focus on what the sport's really about: combining striking and grappling into one fluid
                system. Each session pulls from boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, submission
                grappling, and catch wrestling.</p>

              <div>
                <p class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">What You'll Do:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                  <li>Train striking-only and grappling-only techniques</li>
                  <li>Practice clinch work, takedowns, and transitions</li>
                  <li>Learn to strike while defending takedowns and grapple under pressure</li>
                  <li>Put everything together through live, integrated drills</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>This isn't just cross-training. It's real MMA, taught the right way.</p>
              <p>Build timing, control, and complete fight-ready skills in every class.</p>

              <p>Our Youth Program is designed to teach young athletes the fundamentals of boxing and combat sports,
                while fostering discipline, confidence, and resilience. Under the guidance of the head coach of Penn
                State University's boxing team, a team with a proud 102-year legacy that currently ranks among the top 5
                boxing
                programs in the nation, students receive high-level instruction in a supportive and structured
                environment.</p>

              <p>Boxing is more than a sport; it prepares students to handle real-world challenges by setting achievable
                goals, building mental toughness, and teaching healthy ways to cope with stress. Training is often
                supported by accomplished student-athletes who serve as positive role models, enriching the experience
                both in and out of the ring.</p>

              <p>Most importantly, our Youth Program is designed to be engaging and enjoyable. Judging by the enthusiasm
                and feedback from our young athletes, we are succeeding in making every session a rewarding experience.
