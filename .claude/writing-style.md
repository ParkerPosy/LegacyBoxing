## Core Voice Identity

**Confident authority with an open door.** The site speaks like a coach who's been in the ring, knows their craft, and genuinely wants you to walk in. It's never boastful — every claim is backed by a specific credential, name, or result. And it's never gatekeeping — every paragraph makes space for the person who's never thrown a punch.

### The Formula

```
Credential-backed confidence + Beginner welcome + Structured path forward
```

Every page follows this cycle: establish authority → lower the barrier → invite action.

---

## Voice & Person

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Gym voice** | 1st person plural ("we/our") | "We offer real boxing and authentic MMA training" |
| **Reader address** | 2nd person ("you/your") | "You'll build real technique, conditioning, and fight IQ" |
| **Coach references** | 3rd person by title + last name | "Coach Roth", "Coach Marisa", "Coach Donovan" |
| **Brand name** | Full name on first reference, "Legacy" after | "Legacy Boxing & Combat Sports Academy" → "Legacy" |

**Never:** 1st person singular ("I teach"), passive voice when describing what the gym does ("classes are offered"), overly casual slang, aggressive/macho posturing.

## Tone Attributes (Ranked by Dominance)

### 1. Authentic / "Real"
The word "real" is the single most important tonal anchor. It appears across every major page and signals that this gym delivers substance, not hype.

- "real boxing", "real technique", "real coaching", "real MMA", "real fighting capability", "real skill", "real-world skills", "real results", "real training with real results"
- Avoid: "ultimate", "extreme", "hardcore", "insane" — these belong to a different gym

### 2. Structured / Professional
Every program is described as systematic, not improvised. This separates Legacy from gyms that just "hit pads."

- Key words: "structured", "progressive", "curriculum", "fundamentals", "methodology", "progression plan", "technique-focused", "skill-based"
- "Our boxing classes are structured, progressive, and designed for adults, teens, and women of all experience levels."

### 3. Welcoming / Inclusive
Every mention of intensity is paired with an explicit invitation for beginners. No one should read any page and feel they aren't ready.

- Key patterns: "No experience needed", "Sparring is never required", "all levels welcome", "Whether you're new or experienced"
- "Whether you're training for competition, looking to get in shape, or trying boxing for the first time"

### 4. Credential-Anchored
Claims are never abstract — they reference specific people, awards, and results.

- "named 2023 NCBA Coach of the Year"
- "30+ years of experience"
- "Head Coach of the Penn State University Boxing Club"
- "top civilian boxing program in the United States"
- "Golden Gloves competitors, All-Americans, and national champions"

### 5. Results-Oriented
Copy emphasizes outcomes, not just activities.

- "drives lasting results inside and outside the gym"
- "designed for long-term progress"
- "builds real technique, conditioning, and fight IQ"
- "build timing, control, and fight-ready confidence"

### 6. Community & Safety
Especially prominent on youth and women's pages, but present everywhere.

- "clean, ego-free gym", "safe, positive space", "supportive training environment"
- "focused, supportive environment", "Leave the egos at the door"

## Signature Sentence Patterns

### The "Whether" Bridge
The most characteristic sentence structure on the site. Used to simultaneously address beginners and advanced athletes in a single breath:

```
Whether you're [beginner scenario] or [advanced scenario], [shared benefit].
```

Examples:
- "Whether you're training for competition, looking to get in shape, or trying boxing for the first time, Legacy offers a focused path to progress."
- "Whether you are new to MMA or refining your skill set, our structured approach builds timing, control, and fight-ready confidence."
- "Whether you're brand new, chasing a goal, or just curious about the gym, we'd love to hear from you."

**This pattern should appear on every course page at least once.**

### The Credential Drop
Authority statements placed early in a section, usually within the first 2 paragraphs:

```
[Coach Name] is [role/title]. [Specific achievement]. [What this means for the reader].
```

Example:
- "Coach Derek Roth has been the Head Coach of the Penn State University Boxing Club since 2019, the top-ranked civilian boxing team in the country. Named the 2023 NCBA Coach of the Year, he brings world-class experience to every session at Legacy."

### The Barrier-Lowerer
A direct statement that disarms the most common fear — always follows or closely accompanies any mention of intensity:

```
[Intense-sounding thing]. [But you don't have to worry about that]. [Here's why].
```

Examples:
- "Sparring is never required and only introduced when you're fully prepared, with safety and readiness as the top priority."
- "No experience? No problem. We specialize in beginner boxing classes and steady progression."
- "You'll train like a boxer without ever stepping into the ring unless you're ready."

### The CTA Closer
Paragraphs end with a forward-facing invitation that transitions to the next step:

```
[Summary of value]. [Your first class is free / reach out / see schedule].
```

Example:
- "Your first class is free, so you can experience what sets our athletes apart before committing."

## CTA Language Conventions

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Primary action | Verb + "Your" + Benefit | "Try Your First Class Free", "Book Your First Private Session" |
| Secondary action | "View" / "Find" / "Learn More" | "View Class Schedule", "Find a Class Time" |
| End-of-page | "Learn More About [Program] in State College" | "Learn More About Boxing Classes in State College" |
| Contact-oriented | Warm, non-pushy | "Reach out today – we're ready when you are" |

**CTA rules:**
- Always invitational, never aggressive ("Join NOW!" is wrong for this brand)
- "First class is free" is the universal entry point — mention it on every page
- Title case for button text
- Lowercase prepositions: "Try Your First Class Free" not "Try Your First Class FREE"
- Never use urgency/scarcity language ("Limited spots!", "Sign up before it's too late!")

---

## Heading Conventions

### H1: Service + Location
```
[Service] in State College[, PA] · Legacy Boxing & Combat Sports Academy
```
Examples:
- "MMA and Boxing Gym in State College, PA"
- "Kids Boxing Classes in State College · Legacy Boxing & Combat Sports Academy"

### H2: Benefit or Section Label
Title case, benefit-driven or descriptive:
- "Where You Go to Build Your Legacy"
- "What to Expect in Our Boxing Classes"
- "Why Train Boxing at Legacy?"
- "Meet Coach Roth"

### H3: Subsections
Title case, usually functional:
- "Boxing Class Schedule"
- "Legacy Gym Benefits"
- "What Parents Are Saying"

---

## Paragraph Style

### Opening Paragraphs
Direct-to-benefit, 2-3 sentences. Establish what the page covers and who it's for. Always include a location signal and a keyword-natural hook.

> "Build your skills, confidence, and conditioning in structured, technique-focused classes. No experience needed – start your boxing journey today."

### Body Paragraphs
Medium-to-long (3-5 sentences), conversational but informational. Use specific details — coach names, drill names (Shoulder Tag), credential titles — to build credibility. Avoid generic filler.

> "Classes are led by USA Boxing certified coaches, including Coach Derek Roth – Head Coach of the nationally ranked Penn State University Boxing Club. Coach Roth was named the 2023 NCBA Coach of the Year and brings over 30 years of experience to every session."

### Closing Paragraphs
End with a CTA or forward-looking statement. Always circle back to the reader's next step.

> "Your first class is free, so you can experience what sets our athletes apart before committing. Whether you're looking to compete or just get in shape, our gym is where your boxing journey begins."

## Word Choice Rules

### Preferred Vocabulary

| Use This | Not This | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| real | ultimate, extreme | Brand authenticity over hype |
| structured | rigid, strict | Professional without being intimidating |
| authentic | legit, hardcore | Same — elevated tone |
| discipline | combat sport, fight sport | "Discipline" carries both meanings (martial art + personal quality) |
| certified | licensed, qualified | Matches USA Boxing language |
| beginner-friendly | easy | Implies welcome without undermining the work |
| supportive | chill, relaxed | Warm without casualness |
| progression | levels, ranks | Emphasizes journey, not hierarchy |

### Avoid
`extreme` · `hardcore` · `insane` · `beast mode` · `no pain no gain` · `crush it` · `elite` (borderline — only for truly top-tier contexts) · `world-class` (overused in fitness marketing) · `guaranteed results` · `transform your body`

## SEO Integration Style

Keywords are woven into natural prose — never bolted on or stuffed. The site reads like it was written for humans first, with keywords discovered in the writing rather than imposed on it.

**Good (how the site does it):**
> "Legacy Boxing & Combat Sports Academy is the most complete MMA and boxing gym in State College, offering structured training for beginners, fitness-focused members, and competitive athletes."

**Bad (keyword stuffing — never do this):**
> "Looking for a boxing gym in State College PA? Legacy Boxing is the best boxing gym State College PA has for boxing classes State College."

- Location mentions ("State College", "near Penn State", "Centre County") appear where a human would naturally say them
- Internal link anchor text uses descriptive phrases matching the target page title
- Long-tail keywords emerge from specific, detailed writing, not from forcing them in

---

## Page-Specific Tone Modulations

The core voice stays consistent, but each page type modulates emphasis:

| Page Type | Tone Emphasis | Key Difference |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Homepage** | Broadest — covers all programs, establishes brand | Most balanced; credential-heavy; all-audience |
| **Course pages** (Boxing, MMA) | Confident expertise + beginner welcome | Deepest subject detail; most "Whether" bridges |
| **Private Training** | More premium/exclusive energy | Acceptable to use slightly stronger marketing language; "focused", "personalized", "proven" |
| **Youth Programs** | Softer, parental reassurance | Addresses parents ("your child"); "safe", "fun", "trusted" dominate; no fight/combat language |
| **Schedule** | Functional/utilitarian | Minimal prose; let the schedule speak; brief program summaries in card format |
| **Membership** | Value-driven | Should build perceived value before showing prices (currently underdeveloped) |
| **Contact** | Warm, personal | Shortest prose; invitational, warm; "we're ready when you are" |
| **Gallery** | Visual-first | Minimal text; let images speak; one-line closer |

---

## Testimonial Format

```
"[Quote in first person, 1-2 sentences.]" – [Attribution: role or title, no full name unless permitted]
```

Examples:
- "Coach Derek Roth has a rare gift for breaking down high-level concepts into real-world skills. He made me feel like a fighter from day one." – Legacy Student & PSU Boxing Club Member
- "Coach Roth's clear expertise and experience can be intimidating at first, but he's one of the most kindhearted, patient, and supportive coaches I've ever had." – Former Amateur Boxing Student
- "The coaches are incredibly supportive, and the difference in my daughter's confidence has been amazing." – [Youth parent, unnamed]

---

## Coach Bio Format

Each coach bio follows this structure:
1. **Credentials & competitive record** (1-2 sentences)
2. **Background / story** (1-2 sentences of personal context)
3. **What they bring to Legacy** (1 sentence connecting their experience to coaching)
4. **Coaching philosophy / emphasis** (1 sentence on their approach)

Bios should be roughly equal length (~100-150 words) and maintain the same register — professional but personable, never overly casual.

---

## Formatting Conventions

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Brand name | "Legacy Boxing & Combat Sports Academy" (full) or "Legacy" (short). Use "&" not "and" in brand name. |
| Coach names | "Coach [First Name]" in running text; "Coach [First Last]" on first reference |
| Numbers | Spell out one through nine; use numerals for 10+. Exception: prices, ages, years always numeric ($80, ages 8-16, 30+ years) |
| Dashes | En dash (–) for parenthetical asides and ranges. Use sparingly. Avoid em dashes (—). |
| Apostrophes | Always use straight apostrophes (') in all text. Never use curly/smart apostrophes ('). |
| Lists | Parallel structure – all items start with same part of speech (verb or noun) |
| Prices | "$X.00" format with two decimal places on pricing pages; "$X" without decimals in running text |
| Location | "State College, PA" in H1 tags and first reference; "State College" alone after |
| Time | 12-hour format with AM/PM: "6:15–7:45 PM" using en dash between times |
